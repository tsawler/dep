						<h4 class="trigger"><a href="#">Why are you starting a new publishing company? <i class="icon-plus-sign"></i></a></h4>
						<div class="s-content">
							<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 
							We believe that there are a lot of great authors out there who just can't get the attention of an agent
							or of a traditional publishing house, and we'd like to help them get in front of the reading public. 
							Many aspiring authors are taking the self-publishing route, and while this works for a very, very small number
							of writers, most put their work out there and get lost in the crowd. In addition, a lot of self-published
							authors are desperately in need of an editor&mdash;their work might have great potential, but stylistic, 
							grammatical, and typographical errors tend to get in the way.

						<h4 class="trigger"><a href="#">Is this a vanity press, or a self-publishing company? <i class="icon-plus-sign"></i></a></h4>
						<div class="s-content">
							<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 
								No, this is not a vanity press, and it's not a venue for self-publishing. We will submit each and 
								every manuscript given to us to a strict refereeing process. Every document we receive will 
								be carefully scrutinized by at least three reviewers before we decide if we want to enter into
								an arrangement with the author. We are only interested in high quality stories, and our standards
								are correspondingly high.

						<h4 class="trigger"><a href="#">How much will I make if I publish with you? <i class="icon-plus-sign"></i></a></h4>
						<div class="s-content">
							<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
								The depends entirely on how many copies are sold, but we can tell you that our royalty arrangement is
								set at 75% for the writer, and 25% for us.

						<h4 class="trigger"><a href="#">Do I need an agent to deal with you? <i class="icon-plus-sign"></i></a></h4>
						<div class="s-content">
							<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
								No, you don't. Agents only exist to negotiate, and profit from, the byzantine remuneration structure set up by corporatized publishing houses. Since our royalty model is transparent, and since we're not out to take advantage of anyone, you do not need one to deal with us. Of course, if you already have one, and there is an arrangement in place where your agent has to represent you, we will (grudgingly) talk to your agent.

						<h4 class="trigger"><a href="#">Well, eBooks are great, but what about print? <i class="icon-plus-sign"></i></a></h4>
						<div class="s-content">
							<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 
								Yeah, we've thought about that a lot, and we intend to pursue print publications after we've been up
								and running for awhile. There are a lot of ways of going about it: print on demand, printing small runs 
								until we get a sense of market penetration, and so forth. This is on our radar, but not for the first year.
								For our most successful titles, we fully intend to go down this road, but not for a year or so.

						<h4 class="trigger"><a href="#">What about DRM, or Digital Rights Management? <i class="icon-plus-sign"></i></a></h4>
						<div class="s-content">
							<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 
								Digital Rights Management, or DRM, is a complete and utter waste of time. First, your average twelve year
								old can circumvent it after spending roughly ten minutes searching for the tools to do so. Second, having
								a book that you have bought tied to a specific publisher or a specific device would be a lot like going into your
								favourite bookstore and being told that you are only allowed to read the book you just bought while you 
								are physically in that store. It makes no sense whatsoever. If someone intends to pirate a book, they are
								never going to pay for it in the first place. We'll have no part of any digital rights management system.

						<h4 class="trigger"><a href="#">But won't people pirate my book if it's not protected with DRM? <i class="icon-plus-sign"></i></a></h4>
						<div class="s-content">
							<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 
								That's really not the right question to be asking. You <em>should</em> be asking "but won't <em>more</em> people 
								pirate my book if it's not protected with DRM?" We can answer that one: we don't think so, and we're not just
								guessing. Tor Books made the decision to stop protecting (crippling?) it's entire catalogue with DRM in 2012, 
								and they saw no discernible increase in piracy over the next two years. You can 
								<a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/04/tor-books-uk-drm-free-one-year-later">read all about it here</a>. 
								Simply put, DRM has a negligible impact on reducing piracy, and it is little more than an irritant to the 
								people who actually buy books. It is an exercise in futility, and we hope to see it disappear entirely 
								in the not too distant future, as it has, at least for the most part, with digital music.

						<h4 class="trigger"><a href="#">So what makes this company different? <i class="icon-plus-sign"></i></a></h4>
						<div class="s-content">
							<p><strong>Answer:</strong> We don't simply ask you to upload a story, of whatever quality, and hope for
								the best. We carefully select only those stories that we think are of excellent quality, and then we offer
								editorial services, cover design, marketing and promotion, an advance on royalties, and a royalty stream
								that is as good as, or better than, anything else out there. We think these are rather significant
								differences.

						<h4 class="trigger"><a href="#">I've already published with someone else, but I like your model. Can I submit my manuscript? <i class="icon-plus-sign"></i></a></h4>
						<div class="s-content">
							<p><strong>Answer:</strong> That depends entirely on the arrangement you have with your existing publisher.
								If you just have your books or stories on Amazon KDP or Smashwords, then there is no problem whatsoever.
								You control all the rights. But if you have a publishing arrangement with a traditional publisher, then
								you might not be able to. Consult your agreement with your existing publisher.
